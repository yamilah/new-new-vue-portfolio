        h1 Hello,
        p a designer & web dev based in San Jose, CA. I have experience as both a consultant and as an in-house designer and developer. All of my work is always multi-platform and responsive. As a designer with development experience, I work with implementation in mind; as a designer with consulting experience, I optimize for concision within constraints. I strive for self-sufficiency, and to bring polish into everything I do.

        p In my time as a designer, Iâ€™ve made products for many different users and industries: hospitality, online learning, ecommerce, etc. My background is just as varied, originally a fine artist and architect by training, eventually focusing into graphic design (MassArt 2015, BFA Arts & Design).
        h2 I strive for self-sufficiency, and to bring polish into everything I do.
